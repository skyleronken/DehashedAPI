# DehashedAPI
A web scraped for Dehashed.com

## Disclaimer
Using this project in it's current state is a violation of the Dehashed.com TOS and should not be done. 


Dehashed has since updated to a very reasonable pricing plan for API access. In addition to the improved performance it makes no sense to use this project in its current form. Therefore, I am releasing it to the public. 

If anybody wants to contribute a simple rewrite would be to change from scraping to using the API, but maintaining the exportable formats already included.
